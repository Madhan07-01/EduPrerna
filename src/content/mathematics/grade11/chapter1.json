      "content": "<h4>Introduction</h4><p>The concept of sets forms the foundation of modern mathematics. A set is simply a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as a single entity. These objects are called elements or members of the set. Sets help us represent groups of numbers, symbols, or even real-life objects in a structured way.</p><p>For example:</p><p>The set of vowels in English: V = {a, e, i, o, u}</p><p>The set of natural numbers less than 5: N = {1, 2, 3, 4}</p><p>Sets are widely used in algebra, probability, relations, functions, computer science, and logic.</p>"

        "explanation": "The set of all intelligent students in class is not well-defined because 'intelligent' is subjective and not a precise criterion for membership in a set."

        "answer": "{∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}",
        "explanation": "The power set of A contains all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. For A = {1, 2}, the subsets are: ∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}."

        "explanation": "A′ (complement of A) contains all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A = {1, 2, 3}, A′ = {4, 5}."
