Extending beyond right-angled triangles, trigonometric functions are defined for all real numbers using the unit circle. These functions play a key role in geometry, physics, engineering, astronomy, and calculus.</p>"

        "question": "Convert 150° to radians.",
        "options": ["3π/4", "5π/6", "2π/3", "7π/6"],
        "answer": "5π/6",
        "explanation": "To convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180°. 150° × (π/180°) = 150π/180 = 5π/6 radians."
      },
      {
        "question": "If sin θ = 3/5 and θ is in the first quadrant, what is cos θ?",
        "options": ["3/5", "4/5", "5/4", "5/3"],
        "answer": "4/5",
        "explanation": "Using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1: (3/5)² + cos²θ = 1 → 9/25 + cos²θ = 1 → cos²θ = 16/25 → cos θ = ±4/5. Since θ is in the first quadrant, cos θ is positive, so cos θ = 4/5."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of the following is true?",
        "options": ["sin²θ - cos²θ = 1", "tan²θ + 1 = sec²θ", "cot²θ - 1 = csc²θ", "sin θ + cos θ = 1"],
        "answer": "tan²θ + 1 = sec²θ",
        "explanation": "This is one of the fundamental trigonometric identities. The other options are incorrect: sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 (not subtraction), cot²θ + 1 = csc²θ (not subtraction), and sin θ + cos θ = 1 is not generally true."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the period of tan x?",
        "options": ["π/2", "π", "2π", "4π"],
        "answer": "π",
        "explanation": "The tangent function has a period of π, meaning tan(x + π) = tan(x) for all x in its domain."
      },
      {
        "question": "If cos θ = -12/13 and θ is in the second quadrant, what is sin θ?",
        "options": ["-5/13", "5/13", "12/13", "-12/13"],
        "answer": "5/13",
        "explanation": "Using sin²θ + cos²θ = 1: sin²θ + (-12/13)² = 1 → sin²θ + 144/169 = 1 → sin²θ = 25/169 → sin θ = ±5/13. Since θ is in the second quadrant, sin θ is positive, so sin θ = 5/13."

      {
        "question": "What is sin 225°?",
        "options": ["-√2/2", "√2/2", "-1/2", "1/2"],
        "answer": "-√2/2",
        "explanation": "225° is in the third quadrant where sine is negative. 225° = 180° + 45°, so sin 225° = -sin 45° = -√2/2."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of the following is not defined?",
        "options": ["tan(π/2)", "sin(π/2)", "cos(π/2)", "tan(π/4)"],
        "answer": "tan(π/2)",
        "explanation": "tan(π/2) is undefined because cos(π/2) = 0, and tan θ = sin θ/cos θ, which would involve division by zero. The other values are all defined: sin(π/2) = 1, cos(π/2) = 0, tan(π/4) = 1."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the principal value of sin⁻¹(-1/2)?",
        "options": ["π/6", "-π/6", "5π/6", "-5π/6"],
        "answer": "-π/6",
        "explanation": "The principal value of sin⁻¹x lies in the interval [-π/2, π/2]. Since sin(-π/6) = -1/2 and -π/6 is in the required interval, sin⁻¹(-1/2) = -π/6."
      },

        "question": "If sin A = cos B, what is A + B?",
        "options": ["90°", "180°", "45°", "360°"],
        "answer": "90°",
        "explanation": "If sin A = cos B, then A and B are complementary angles. This is because sin θ = cos(90° - θ). So if sin A = cos B, then A = 90° - B, which means A + B = 90°."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the range of y = sin x?",
        "options": ["(-∞, ∞)", "[-1, 1]", "[0, 1]", "[-π/2, π/2]"],
        "answer": "[-1, 1]",
        "explanation": "The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1 for all real values of x. Therefore, the range of y = sin x is [-1, 1]."
