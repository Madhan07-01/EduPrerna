Once we know how to describe sets, we often want to study how elements of one set are connected to elements of another. This brings us to relations and functions.</p><p>A relation shows how two sets are associated.</p><p>A function is a special kind of relation where each element of the first set is connected to exactly one element of the second set.</p><p>These concepts are central in algebra, calculus, computer science, and real-world applications like mapping, coding, and data analysis.</p>"

        "options": ["2", "4", "6", "8"],
        "answer": "4",
        "explanation": "The Cartesian product A × B contains all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Since A has 2 elements and B has 2 elements, A × B has 2 × 2 = 4 elements: {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}."

        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a function?",
        "options": ["f(x) = 2x + 1", "f(x) = x²", "f(x) = ±√x", "f(x) = x³"],
        "answer": "f(x) = ±√x",
        "explanation": "A function must assign exactly one output to each input. f(x) = ±√x assigns two values (positive and negative) to each positive input, so it is not a function. The other options are all valid functions."

        "question": "What is the domain of f(x) = 1/(x - 2)?",
        "options": ["R", "R - {0}", "R - {2}", "R - {-2}"],
        "answer": "R - {2}",
        "explanation": "The function f(x) = 1/(x - 2) is undefined when the denominator is zero, which occurs when x = 2. Therefore, the domain is all real numbers except 2, written as R - {2}."

      {
        "question": "If R = {(a, a): a ∈ A} where A = {1, 2, 3}, what type of relation is R?",
        "options": ["Empty relation", "Universal relation", "Equivalence relation", "Function"],
        "answer": "Equivalence relation",
        "explanation": "R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)} is reflexive (every element relates to itself), symmetric (if (a, a) ∈ R, then (a, a) ∈ R), and transitive (if (a, a) ∈ R and (a, a) ∈ R, then (a, a) ∈ R). Therefore, R is an equivalence relation."

        "options": ["One-one but not onto", "Onto but not one-one", "Bijective", "Neither one-one nor onto"],
        "answer": "Bijective",
        "explanation": "f(x) = 2x + 3 is a linear function with slope 2 ≠ 0. It is one-one (injective) because different inputs give different outputs, and it is onto (surjective) because every real number y can be obtained as f(x) = y by choosing x = (y - 3)/2. Therefore, f is bijective."

        "options": ["5", "6", "8", "64"],
        "answer": "64",
        "explanation": "If set A has 3 elements and set B has 2 elements, then A × B has 3 × 2 = 6 elements. A relation from A to B is any subset of A × B. The number of subsets of a set with 6 elements is 2⁶ = 64."

        "options": ["One-one but not onto", "Onto but not one-one", "Bijective", "Neither one-one nor onto"],
        "answer": "Bijective",
        "explanation": "f(x) = x³ is strictly increasing, meaning different inputs give different outputs (one-one). It also covers all real numbers in its range (onto). Therefore, f is bijective."

      {
        "question": "If f(x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) = x², what is (g ∘ f)(x)?",

        "answer": "(2x + 1)²",
        "explanation": "The composition (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(2x + 1) = (2x + 1)²."

        "answer": "(x + 4)/3",
        "explanation": "To find the inverse, we solve y = 3x - 4 for x: y = 3x - 4 → y + 4 = 3x → x = (y + 4)/3. Therefore, f⁻¹(x) = (x + 4)/3."

        "answer": "f(x) = x",
        "explanation": "The identity function on R maps every real number to itself, so f(x) = x for all x ∈ R."
