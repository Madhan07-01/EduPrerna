Integers help us represent quantities that have opposite directions or opposite values, such as gaining or losing money, rising above or falling below sea level, or temperature changes.</p><p>Understanding integers is important because they are widely used in daily life, mathematics, and computer science.</p><p>Examples of integers:</p><ul><li>Positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 10, 100</li><li>Negative integers: -1, -2, -5, -50</li><li>Zero: 0</li></ul><p>Note: Zero is neither positive nor negative.</p>"

        "options": ["12", "-2", "2", "-12"],
        "answer": "-2",
        "explanation": "To add integers with different signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. |-7| = 7, |5| = 5. Since 7 > 5, we subtract: 7 - 5 = 2, and take the negative sign: -2."

        "explanation": "Among negative integers, the one with the smallest absolute value is the greatest. |-1| = 1, |-3| = 3, |-5| = 5, |-7| = 7. Since 1 is the smallest absolute value, -1 is the greatest."

        "explanation": "Positive numbers are always greater than negative numbers, so -8 > 5 is false. Among negative numbers, the one with smaller absolute value is greater. |-3| = 3 and |-7| = 7, so -3 > -7, making -3 < -7 false. Zero is greater than any negative number, so 0 < -1 is false. |-2| = 2 and |-5| = 5, so -2 > -5 is true."

        "explanation": "When adding integers with different signs, we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. For example: 7 + (-4) = 3 (positive because |7| > |-4|), and (-8) + 3 = -5 (negative because |-8| > |3|). If the absolute values are equal, the sum is zero: 5 + (-5) = 0."
