Whether it's knowing the time, checking the temperature, or scoring marks in an exam, numbers are always there.</p><p>But numbers come in different types: whole numbers, integers, fractions, and decimals. Together, these types form the Number System â€” the foundation of all mathematics.</p>"

        "options": ["0", "â€“2", "5"],
        "answer": "5",
        "explanation": "Natural numbers are the basic counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ They start from 1 and do not include zero or negative numbers."

        "options": ["â€“1", "0", "1"],
        "answer": "0",
        "explanation": "Whole numbers include all natural numbers plus zero. So they start from 0: {0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦}."

        "options": ["4.5", "â€“7", "Â½"],
        "answer": "â€“7",
        "explanation": "Integers include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. They do not include fractions or decimals. â€“7 is a negative integer."

        "question": "Which of the following is a fraction?",
        "options": ["25", "â€“3", "Â¾"],
        "answer": "Â¾",
        "explanation": "A fraction represents a part of a whole and is written as a/b where a is the numerator and b is the denominator. Â¾ is a fraction."

        "options": ["5Â°C", "8Â°C", "3Â°C"],
        "answer": "8Â°C",
        "explanation": "To find the temperature fall, calculate the difference: 5 - (â€“3) = 5 + 3 = 8Â°C."
