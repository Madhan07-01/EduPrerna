However, in real life, we also encounter numbers that are less than zero. For example:</p><ul><li>The temperature in some places can be -5Â°C.</li><li>In a game, if you lose 10 points, your score may become negative.</li><li>When withdrawing money from a bank, your account balance might drop below zero, showing negative balance.</li></ul><p>To handle such situations, we use integers. Integers include both positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.</p>"

        "answer": "â€“2",
        "explanation": "Integers include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. They do not include fractions or decimals. â€“2 is a negative integer."

        "options": ["â€“7", "â€“4"],
        "answer": "â€“4",
        "explanation": "Among negative integers, the one with a smaller absolute value is greater. Since |-4| = 4 and |-7| = 7, and 4 < 7, -4 is greater than -7."

        "question": "The opposite of â€“8 is:",
        "options": ["â€“8", "0", "+8", "â€“1"],
        "answer": "+8",
        "explanation": "The opposite of a number is the number with the opposite sign. The opposite of -8 is +8."

        "options": ["+15", "â€“3", "+3", "â€“15"],
        "answer": "+3",
        "explanation": "To add integers with different signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. |+9| = 9, |-6| = 6. Since 9 > 6, we subtract: 9 - 6 = 3, and take the positive sign: +3."

        "options": ["â€“7", "â€“3", "+3", "+7"],
        "answer": "â€“3",
        "explanation": "To subtract integers, change the sign of the second number and then add. (â€“5) â€“ (â€“2) = (â€“5) + (+2) = â€“3."

        "answer": "â€“7 < â€“2",
        "explanation": "Negative numbers are less than positive numbers, so â€“3 > +2 is false. Among negative numbers, the one with the larger absolute value is smaller, so â€“2 < â€“5 is false. â€“7 < â€“2 is true because |-7| = 7 and |-2| = 2, and 7 > 2, so â€“7 < â€“2.

        "answer": "+30",
        "explanation": "When multiplying integers with the same sign, the result is positive. (â€“6) Ã— (â€“5) = +30."

        "explanation": "The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line. Both +9 and â€“9 are 9 units away from zero, so if |x| = 9, then x can be either +9 or â€“9."

        "explanation": "On a number line, numbers decrease as we move to the left. Among the given options, â€“10 is the smallest number, so it is farthest to the left."
