        "options": ["2", "4", "5", "6"],
        "answer": "4",
        "explanation": "The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set. In the data 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, 4, 5, the number 4 appears three times, which is more frequent than any other number. Therefore, the mode is 4."

      {
        "question": "The mean of numbers 5, 10, 15 is:",
        "options": ["10", "15", "12.5", "30"],
        "answer": "10",
        "explanation": "The mean (average) is calculated by adding all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers. Mean = (5 + 10 + 15) / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10."

        "question": "Which of these is the middle value of 7, 9, 5, 12, 8 when arranged in order?",
        "options": ["7", "8", "9", "12"],
        "answer": "8",
        "explanation": "To find the median, first arrange the data in ascending order: 5, 7, 8, 9, 12. The middle value is 8, so the median is 8."

        "question": "In a tally chart, |||| represents:",
        "options": ["10", "1", "5", "4"],
        "answer": "5",
        "explanation": "In a tally chart, each vertical line represents 1, and every fifth line is drawn diagonally across the previous four lines to represent 5. So |||| represents 5."

        "question": "Which graph is best suited to show comparison of two different groups?",
        "options": ["Pictograph", "Double Bar Graph", "Line Graph", "Pie Chart"],
        "answer": "Double Bar Graph",
        "explanation": "A double bar graph is specifically designed to compare two sets of data side by side. It uses two bars for each category to make comparisons easy."

        "answer": "8 apples",
        "explanation": "If one üçé symbol represents 2 apples, then four üçé symbols represent 4 √ó 2 = 8 apples."

        "options": ["1/2", "1/3", "1/6", "1/4"],
        "answer": "1/6",
        "explanation": "A standard die has 6 faces numbered 1 through 6. There is only one favorable outcome (getting a 3) out of 6 possible outcomes. So the probability is 1/6."

        "options": ["20", "30", "40", "25"],
        "answer": "30",
        "explanation": "To find the median, arrange the data in order (already done) and find the middle value. Since there are 5 values, the middle one is the third value, which is 30."

        "question": "A bar graph has bars of different ______.",
        "options": ["colours", "lengths", "widths", "shapes"],
        "answer": "lengths",
        "explanation": "In a bar graph, the length (or height) of each bar represents the value of the data it represents. Bars of different lengths show different values."
