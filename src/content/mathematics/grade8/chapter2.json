      "content": "<h4>Introduction</h4><p>Equations are like balance scales — both sides must be equal. When an equation contains only first power of the variable (like x, not x² or x³), it is called a linear equation. Linear equations are very useful in solving real-life problems such as calculating costs, comparing quantities, or finding unknown values.</p>"

        "question": "The solution of 2x + 5 = 15 is:",
        "options": ["5", "10", "15", "20"],
        "answer": "5",
        "explanation": "Solving 2x + 5 = 15: 2x = 15 - 5 = 10, so x = 5."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of the following is a linear equation in one variable?",
        "options": ["2x² + 3 = 0", "x + 7 = 12", "xy = 10", "y² – 4 = 0"],
        "answer": "x + 7 = 12",
        "explanation": "A linear equation in one variable has the form ax + b = 0 where the variable is only to the first power. x + 7 = 12 fits this definition."

        "options": ["x = 6", "x = –6", "x = 2/3", "x = 3"],
        "answer": "x = 6",
        "explanation": "Solving 3x - 7 = 11: 3x = 11 + 7 = 18, so x = 6."
      },

        "question": "Which of these points is a solution of 2x + y = 7?",
        "options": ["(2,3)", "(1,2)", "(3,2)", "(4,2)"],
        "answer": "(2,3)",
        "explanation": "Substituting (2,3) into 2x + y = 7: 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7. This satisfies the equation."

        "options": ["x + y = 2", "x – y = 4", "y = 2x", "x = 4"],
        "answer": "x + y = 2",
        "explanation": "Lines are parallel if they have the same coefficients for x and y. x + y = 2 has the same coefficients (1,1) as x + y = 4, so they are parallel."

        "answer": "y = 2",
        "explanation": "A line parallel to the x-axis has a constant y-value, so its equation is of the form y = c, where c is a constant."

        "options": ["6", "9", "3", "12"],
        "answer": "9",
        "explanation": "Solving x/3 + 2 = 5: x/3 = 5 - 2 = 3, so x = 3 × 3 = 9."
