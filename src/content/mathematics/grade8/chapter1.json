For example, when you share a chocolate bar equally among 3 friends, you get fractions like 1/3. These are not integers, but they are still numbers we use in daily life. Such numbers are called rational numbers. They help us represent parts of a whole, ratios, and values between integers.</p>"

        "options": ["√2", "π", "–7/3", "None of these"],
        "answer": "–7/3",
        "explanation": "A rational number is any number that can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. –7/3 fits this definition."
      },
      {
        "question": "The standard form of –15/–35 is:",
        "options": ["15/35", "3/7", "–3/7", "7/15"],
        "answer": "3/7",
        "explanation": "To get the standard form, we simplify –15/–35 = 15/35 = 3/7. In standard form, the denominator must be positive."

        "question": "Which property is shown by 2/3 + 4/5 = 4/5 + 2/3?",
        "options": ["Closure", "Commutative", "Associative", "Distributive"],
        "answer": "Commutative",
        "explanation": "The commutative property states that the order of addition does not affect the result: a + b = b + a."

        "question": "The reciprocal of –7/9 is:",
        "options": ["7/9", "–9/7", "–7/9", "9/7"],
        "answer": "–9/7",
        "explanation": "The reciprocal of a fraction a/b is b/a. So the reciprocal of –7/9 is 9/–7 = –9/7."

        "options": ["0/5", "–11/7", "5", "All are rational numbers"],
        "answer": "All are rational numbers",
        "explanation": "All the given options are rational numbers. 0/5 = 0, –11/7, 5 = 5/1, and 9/–3 = –3 are all rational numbers."

        "answer": "19/12",
        "explanation": "To add 3/4 + 5/6, we find the LCM of denominators (12). 3/4 = 9/12 and 5/6 = 10/12. So 9/12 + 10/12 = 19/12."

        "answer": "–1 and 0",
        "explanation": "Since –5/8 is negative but greater than –1 (because 5/8 < 1), it lies between –1 and 0 on the number line."

        "question": "Which is greater: 7/12 or 5/8?",
        "options": ["7/12", "5/8", "Both equal", "Cannot be compared"],
        "answer": "5/8",
        "explanation": "To compare, we convert to common denominator. LCM of 12 and 8 is 24. 7/12 = 14/24 and 5/8 = 15/24. Since 15/24 > 14/24, 5/8 is greater."
