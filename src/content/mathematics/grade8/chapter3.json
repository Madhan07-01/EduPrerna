Quadrilaterals are everywhere around us — in windows, tables, books, tiles, and even in playing cards. Studying quadrilaterals helps us understand their shapes, properties, and how they are classified.</p>"

        "question": "In a parallelogram, opposite angles are:",
        "options": ["Equal", "Unequal", "Right angles", "None"],
        "answer": "Equal",
        "explanation": "One of the key properties of a parallelogram is that opposite angles are equal."

        "options": ["Equal and perpendicular", "Equal and bisect each other", "Unequal and bisect", "Perpendicular but not equal"],
        "answer": "Equal and bisect each other",
        "explanation": "In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other, but they are not necessarily perpendicular."

        "question": "Which quadrilateral has all sides equal but angles not 90°?",
        "options": ["Square", "Rectangle", "Rhombus", "Kite"],
        "answer": "Rhombus",
        "explanation": "A rhombus has all sides equal, but its angles are not necessarily 90°. A square has all sides equal and all angles 90°."

        "options": ["80°", "90°", "100°", "120°"],
        "answer": "90°",
        "explanation": "The sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°. So the fourth angle = 360° - (80° + 100° + 90°) = 360° - 270° = 90°."
