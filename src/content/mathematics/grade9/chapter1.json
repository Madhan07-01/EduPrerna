        "options": ["Terminating only", "Non-terminating, repeating or terminating", "Non-terminating, non-repeating", "Cannot be determined"],
        "answer": "Non-terminating, repeating or terminating",

        "answer": "√5",
        "explanation": "√5 cannot be expressed as p/q and has a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal expansion, making it irrational."

        "explanation": "7/8 = 0.875, which is a terminating decimal. 1/3 = 0.333... and 2/11 = 0.181818... are repeating decimals."
