        "answer": "3x³ – 7x + 2",
        "explanation": "3x³ – 7x + 2 is a polynomial because it has no negative powers or division by variable. x² + 1/x and 5/x have variables in the denominator, which is not allowed."

        "explanation": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable. Here, the highest power is 4."

        "explanation": "A zero of p(x) is a value that makes p(x) = 0. p(2) = 2² – 4 = 4 – 4 = 0, so 2 is a zero."
