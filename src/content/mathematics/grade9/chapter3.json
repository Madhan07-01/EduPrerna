        "question": "The coordinates of the origin are:",
        "options": ["(1,1)", "(0,1)", "(0,0)", "(1,0)"],
        "answer": "(0,0)",
        "explanation": "The origin is the point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect, and its coordinates are (0,0)."
      },
      {
        "question": "The abscissa of (7, –3) is:",
        "options": ["–3", "7", "10", "3"],
        "answer": "7",
        "explanation": "The abscissa is the x-coordinate of a point. For (7, –3), the abscissa is 7."
      },

        "question": "The ordinate of (–5, 4) is:",
        "options": ["–5", "5", "4", "–4"],
        "answer": "4",
        "explanation": "The ordinate is the y-coordinate of a point. For (–5, 4), the ordinate is 4."
      },
      {
        "question": "In which quadrant does (–2, –5) lie?",
        "options": ["Quadrant I", "Quadrant II", "Quadrant III", "Quadrant IV"],
        "answer": "Quadrant III",
        "explanation": "In Quadrant III, both x and y coordinates are negative. Since (–2, –5) has both coordinates negative, it lies in Quadrant III."
      },
      {
        "question": "Distance between (0,0) and (6,8) is:",
        "options": ["10", "12", "8", "6"],
        "answer": "10",
        "explanation": "Using the distance formula: d = √[(6–0)² + (8–0)²] = √[36 + 64] = √100 = 10."
      },
      {
        "question": "Midpoint of (2,3) and (4,7) is:",
        "options": ["(2,5)", "(3,5)", "(4,6)", "(3,7)"],
        "answer": "(3,5)",
        "explanation": "Using the midpoint formula: ((2+4)/2, (3+7)/2) = (6/2, 10/2) = (3,5)."
      },
      {
        "question": "The point (0, –4) lies on:",
        "options": ["x-axis", "y-axis", "origin", "Quadrant II"],
        "answer": "y-axis",
        "explanation": "Any point with x-coordinate 0 lies on the y-axis. Since (0, –4) has x=0, it lies on the y-axis."
      },
      {
        "question": "A point dividing (2, –2) and (8, 10) in ratio 1:2 is:",
        "options": ["(4,2)", "(6,6)", "(5,6)", "(3,4)"],
        "answer": "(4,2)",
        "explanation": "Using the section formula with m=1, n=2: P = ((1×8 + 2×2)/(1+2), (1×10 + 2×(–2))/(1+2)) = ((8+4)/3, (10–4)/3) = (12/3, 6/3) = (4,2)."

        "options": ["Not collinear", "Collinear", "Form a triangle", "None"],
        "answer": "Collinear",
        "explanation": "All three points lie on the line y=x, so they are collinear."

        "question": "The point equidistant from (2,3) and (–2,3) is:",
        "options": ["(0,3)", "(2,0)", "(0,0)", "(3,0)"],
        "answer": "(0,3)",
        "explanation": "Since both points have the same y-coordinate (3), the point equidistant from them will have the same y-coordinate and an x-coordinate that is the average of their x-coordinates: (2 + (–2))/2 = 0. So the point is (0,3)."
