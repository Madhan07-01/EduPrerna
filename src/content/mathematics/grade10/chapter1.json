Together, all these form the set of real numbers. Real numbers are the foundation of algebra and geometry. They allow us to perform arithmetic, solve equations, and represent points on the number line.</p><p>The study of real numbers in Grade 10 focuses mainly on the properties of prime numbers, the Euclid's Division Lemma, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, and decimal expansions of rational numbers. These concepts are useful not just in pure mathematics but also in cryptography, computer science, and engineering.</p>"
