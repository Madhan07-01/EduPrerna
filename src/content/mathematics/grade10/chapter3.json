        "answer": "ax + by + c = 0",
        "explanation": "The general form of a linear equation in two variables is ax + by + c = 0, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a, b are not both zero."

        "options": ["Intersecting lines", "Coincident lines", "Parallel lines", "Perpendicular lines"],
        "answer": "Coincident lines",
        "explanation": "The second equation is exactly twice the first equation (4x+6y=14 is 2(2x+3y=7)). So they represent the same line, hence coincident lines."

        "options": ["One solution", "Two solutions", "Infinitely many solutions", "No solution"],
        "answer": "No solution",
        "explanation": "Parallel lines never intersect, so there is no point (x,y) that satisfies both equations simultaneously. Hence, no solution."

        "answer": "Infinitely many solutions",
        "explanation": "The second equation is exactly twice the first equation (6x+4y=10 is 2(3x+2y=5)). So they represent the same line, hence infinitely many solutions."

        "explanation": "Adding the equations: (x+y)+(x-y) = 10+2 → 2x = 12 → x = 6. Substituting in first equation: 6+y = 10 → y = 4. So solution is (6,4)."

        "options": ["Intersecting lines", "Parallel lines", "Coincident lines", "Perpendicular lines"],
        "answer": "Coincident lines",
        "explanation": "The second equation is exactly 3 times the first equation (3x+6y–15 = 3(x+2y–5)). So they represent the same line, hence coincident lines."
