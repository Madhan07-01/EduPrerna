        "options": ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
        "answer": "4",
        "explanation": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable. In 7x⁴–3x²+2x–9, the highest power is 4."

        "options": ["x²+3", "2x+7", "x³-1", "x⁴+x"],
        "answer": "2x+7",
        "explanation": "A linear polynomial has degree 1. 2x+7 is linear because the highest power of x is 1."

        "options": ["±2", "±4", "±8", "±16"],
        "answer": "±4",
        "explanation": "x²–16 = (x–4)(x+4) = 0. So x = 4 or x = -4. The zeros are ±4."

        "answer": "Sum=5, Product=6",
        "explanation": "For ax²+bx+c, sum of zeros = -b/a and product = c/a. Here a=1, b=-5, c=6. So sum = -(-5)/1 = 5 and product = 6/1 = 6."

        "answer": "2x³ + 1/x",
        "explanation": "2x³ + 1/x is not a polynomial because it contains 1/x, which is equivalent to x⁻¹. Polynomials can only have non-negative integer powers of variables."

        "explanation": "If zeros are –2 and –3, the polynomial is (x+2)(x+3) = x²+3x+2x+6 = x²+5x+6. Comparing with x²+kx+6, we get k = 5."
