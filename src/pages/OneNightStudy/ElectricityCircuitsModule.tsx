      title: 'What is Electricity?',
      content: 'Electricity is a form of energy caused by the movement of tiny particles called electrons. When electrons move through materials, they create an electric current that can power our devices and light our homes.',
      examples: [
        'Lightning is a natural form of electricity in the sky',
        'Static electricity makes your hair stand up when you rub a balloon on it',
        'Electric current flows through wires like water flows through pipes',
        'Electrons are so small you can\'t see them, but millions move through wires every second',
        'Electric current is measured in units called amperes (amps)'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Electric Current and How It Flows',
      content: 'Electric current is the flow of electrons through a conductor. For current to flow, electrons need a complete path to travel from one place to another and back again.',
      examples: [
        'Current flows from positive to negative terminals in a circuit',
        'Think of current like water flowing through a garden hose',
        'The stronger the current, the more electrons are flowing',
        'Current needs a complete loop (circuit) to keep flowing',
        'If the path is broken, current stops flowing (like turning off a switch)'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Circuit Components and Their Functions',
      content: 'Circuits are made up of different components that each have special jobs. Understanding these parts helps us build and fix electrical devices.',
      examples: [
        'Battery: Provides the electrical energy (like a power source)',
        'Wires: Carry the electric current from place to place',
        'Light bulb: Uses electrical energy to produce light and heat',
        'Switch: Controls whether current can flow or not',
        'Resistor: Controls how much current flows through the circuit'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Series Circuits',
      content: 'A series circuit has only one path for electric current to flow. All components are connected in a single line, like cars on a train track.',
      examples: [
        'Christmas lights often use series circuits (old-style ones)',
        'If one bulb burns out, all bulbs go dark',
        'Current is the same throughout the entire circuit',
        'Adding more bulbs makes all bulbs dimmer',
        'Only one switch controls the entire circuit'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Parallel Circuits',
      content: 'A parallel circuit has multiple paths for electric current to flow. Each component has its own separate branch, like lanes on a highway.',
      examples: [
        'House wiring uses parallel circuits',
        'If one bulb burns out, others stay bright',
        'Each branch can be controlled by its own switch',
        'Adding more bulbs doesn\'t make others dimmer',

      title: 'Conductors vs Insulators',
      content: 'Materials can be classified based on how well they allow electricity to flow through them. This property determines how we use them in electrical applications.',
      examples: [
        'Conductors: Copper wire, aluminum, gold, silver, water with salt',
        'Insulators: Rubber, plastic, glass, wood, pure water',
        'Wire coating is made of plastic (insulator) for safety',
        'Metal parts of plugs conduct electricity to devices',
        'Never touch exposed wires - the metal conducts electricity!'
      ]

    {
      title: 'Electrical Safety Rules',
      content: 'Electricity can be dangerous if not handled properly. Following safety rules protects us from electric shock and prevents fires.',
      examples: [
        'Never put metal objects in electrical outlets',
        'Keep electrical devices away from water',
        'Don\'t touch electrical wires with wet hands',
        'Unplug devices by pulling the plug, not the cord',
        'Tell an adult if you see damaged electrical cords or outlets'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Voltage and Electrical Pressure',
      content: 'Voltage is like electrical pressure that pushes electrons through a circuit. Higher voltage means more force pushing the electrons along.',
      examples: [
        'Batteries have different voltages: AA battery (1.5V), car battery (12V)',
        'House outlets provide 120V in North America',
        'Voltage is measured in volts (V)',
        'Think of voltage like water pressure in pipes',
        'Higher voltage can push current through materials that resist flow'

      title: 'Resistance and Controlling Current',
      content: 'Resistance is how much a material opposes the flow of electric current. Different materials and components have different amounts of resistance.',
      examples: [
        'Thin wires have more resistance than thick wires',
        'Long wires have more resistance than short wires',
        'Resistance is measured in ohms (Î©)',
        'Light bulb filaments have high resistance to produce heat and light',
