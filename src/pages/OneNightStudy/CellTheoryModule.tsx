  title: 'The Fundamental Unit of Life â€“ Cell Theory',
  introduction: 'Welcome to the extraordinary world of Cell Theory! Every living thing around you - from the tiniest bacteria to the largest whale, from the grass beneath your feet to the neurons in your brain - shares one fundamental truth: they are all made of cells! The discovery of cells revolutionized our understanding of life itself and laid the foundation for all modern biology. Cell Theory is one of the most important scientific theories ever developed, explaining how life works at its most basic level. Get ready to explore the incredible journey of discovery that revealed the secrets of life\'s building blocks and learn how these microscopic structures create the amazing diversity of life on Earth!',
