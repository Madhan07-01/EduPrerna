# Grade 12 Mathematics Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the Grade 12 Mathematics course in the EduPrerna platform.

## Chapters Implemented

1. **Relations and Functions**
2. **Inverse Trigonometric Functions**
3. **Matrices**

## Features

### Learning Flow
- Single-card flow for lessons with next/previous navigation
- Progress bar to show completion
- Start Quiz button after finishing all topics

### Quizzes
- 10 questions per chapter with 30s timer
- Instant feedback with ✅ correct / ❌ wrong + explanation
- Final score summary with motivational message

### Interactive Components

#### Chapter 1: Relations and Functions
- **RelationGraphBuilder**: Interactive tool to visualize relations between sets and identify function types
- **FunctionVisualizer**: Real-time function mapping with adjustable coefficients

#### Chapter 2: Inverse Trigonometric Functions
- **InverseTrigUnitCircle**: Animated unit circle to visualize inverse trigonometric functions

#### Chapter 3: Matrices
- **MatrixPlayground**: Drag-and-drop matrix cells with auto-multiplication capabilities

### Gamification
- Badges for completion: "Relation Master", "Trig Expert", "Matrix Magician"
- Animations: Confetti for correct answers, gentle shake for wrong answers

```

## Technical Details

### Content Structure
Each chapter JSON file contains:
- Chapter metadata (title, description)
- Multiple sub-chapters with content
- Interactive component references
- Quiz questions with explanations

### Component Integration
Interactive components are referenced in the content files and dynamically loaded in the lesson viewer.

### Backward Compatibility
The lessonContentLoader utility was updated to handle both the existing content structure (Grades 6-11) and the new structure (Grade 12) through TypeScript type guards.

## Usage

To access the Grade 12 Mathematics content:
1. Navigate to the Mathematics subject
2. Select Grade 12
3. Choose any of the three chapters
4. Progress through the lessons and interactive components
5. Complete the quiz at the end of each chapter
