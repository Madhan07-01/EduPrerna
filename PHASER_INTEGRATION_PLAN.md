# Phaser.js Integration Plan

## Current Implementation
The Mini Games currently use CSS animations as placeholders for Phaser.js integration:

### MathRunnerGame.tsx
- **Character animations**: Running, jumping, stumbling states
- **Background movement**: Scrolling background simulation
- **Visual feedback**: Color changes and position transforms

### Animation States
```typescript
characterAnimation: 'running' | 'jumping' | 'stumbling'
```

### Current CSS Animations
- `animate-bounce` for running
- `animate-ping` for jumping
- `animate-pulse` for stumbling

## Future Phaser.js Integration

### Step 1: Install Phaser.js
```bash
npm install phaser @types/phaser
```

### Step 2: Create Phaser Game Component
- Replace CSS animations with Phaser.js sprites
- Add physics-based movement
- Implement smooth character animations
- Add particle effects for correct/incorrect answers

### Step 3: Enhanced Features
- **Character sprites**: Replace emojis with animated sprites
- **Background parallax**: Multi-layer scrolling backgrounds
- **Particle effects**: Stars, sparks, and explosion effects
- **Sound effects**: Audio feedback for actions
- **Smooth transitions**: Between levels and questions

### Step 4: Game-Specific Enhancements
- **Math Runner**: Physics-based jumping and running
- **Geometry Shooter**: Projectile physics and target animations
- **Equation Builder**: Drag-and-drop physics with snap-to-grid

## Benefits of Phaser.js
1. **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
2. **Rich animations**: Sprite-based character movements
3. **Physics engine**: Realistic movement and collisions
4. **Audio support**: Integrated sound management
5. **Asset management**: Efficient loading and caching

## Implementation Priority
- Phase 1: Core game mechanics (âœ… Complete)
- Phase 2: Enhanced UI and game flow (âœ… Complete)
- Phase 3: Phaser.js integration (ðŸš§ Future enhancement)
- Phase 4: Advanced game features (ðŸ“… Planned)

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that can be enhanced with Phaser.js without requiring major architectural changes.
